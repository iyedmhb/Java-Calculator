# 🚀 SuperCalc 3000: The Calculator That's Out of This World! 🌟

Welcome to SuperCalc 3000, where math meets fun! This isn't your grandpa's calculator - it's a sleek, object-oriented powerhouse that'll make you say, "Wow, I never thought I'd be this excited about arithmetic!" 🤓✨

## 🎭 The Cast of Characters

Our software is like a superhero team, but for math:

- `Calculator`: The wise mentor, guiding all operations from the shadows.
- `Addition`: The friendly neighborhood hero, bringing numbers together!
- `Subtraction`: The cool rebel, always taking things away (but in a good way).
- `Multiplication`: The overachiever, making numbers grow exponentially.
- `Division`: The daredevil, walking the thin line of zero (but never crossing it).

## 🚦 How to Join the Math Party

1. Clone this repo (or download it, we don't judge).
2. Compile the code:
   ```
   javac MySoftware.java
   ```
3. Run it like you mean it:
   ```
   java MySoftware <operator> <A> <B>
   ```
   Replace `<operator>` with +, -, *, or / (choose wisely!).
   `<A>` and `<B>` are your lucky numbers.

## 🎮 Usage Examples

```bash
java MySoftware + 5 3    # Returns: 8
java MySoftware - 10 7   # Returns: 3
java MySoftware '*' 4 6  # Returns: 24
java MySoftware / 15 3   # Returns: 5
```

Pro tip: For multiplication, use '*' (with quotes) to avoid shell expansion. We're smart, but we can't outsmart your shell!

## 🛡️ Safety First!

We've got your back:
- Try to divide by zero, and we'll give you a friendly reminder that it's a no-go.
- Forget an argument? We'll tell you how to use the program correctly.
- Input something that's not a number? We'll let you know gently.

## 🎨 Customization

Feel like a math wizard and want to add more operations? Go for it! Just remember:
1. Create a new class extending `Calculator`.
2. Implement the `compute` method.
3. Add your new operation to the `switch` statement in `MySoftware`.

## 🚀 Final Thoughts

Remember, with great calculation comes great responsibility. Use this power wisely, and may your computations be ever in your favor!

Happy calculating! 🎉🧮✨
